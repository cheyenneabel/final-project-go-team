                Have you ever wanted to play a game, but you're down one person? Or what if you want
                to make some new friends and start a weekly game at a local park?

                Go Team is an application to help people in the area play more games. Once you have
                an account, you will select the sport you are interested in playing. Then you are given
                the option to join an available game or schedule a new game. Users can search for
                a game by skill level or location.

                We hope that this is an accessible and fun way for our community to play more sports!
